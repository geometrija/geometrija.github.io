<h4>From the exhibition catalog:</h4>
<p>The exhibition ‘Femininity in Geometric Abstraction’ is, I hope, just
the beginning of a new focus on the art of geometric abstraction in
Serbia in general. I organized and prepared the exhibition without any
institutional or financial support from the Republic of Serbia,
excluding the Modern Gallery Lazarevac, which recognized its value in
its concept. Abstract art shows even today, more than a hundred years
since it was discovered in the form that history of art recognizes as an
aesthetic and conceptual unity, the potential for infinite exploration.
All the works of the artists who participated in this project testify to
this. I see no reason whatsoever why my efforts in its development and
promotion should end with this exhibition, and I take this opportunity
to already announce the plan to develop this exhibition into a biennial
event of geometric abstraction art.</p>
<p>In previous decades, there has been no systematic effort in our
country to identify and present the contribution to this branch of
abstract art specifically by female artists. This is what primarily
motivated me to develop and implement such a project. I am sure that the
works of the seventeen artists, presented individually but with a
unified expression, testify to an extraordinary creative energy that we
can recognize as a whole despite all the differences in individual
sensibilities. I believe that this is sufficient motivation for future
gatherings and research in the direction that this exhibition has only
outlined. That is also the reason why, in this introductory
consideration, I avoided all attempts at aesthetic-conceptual
classifications, theoretical analysis, even superficial systematization.
I believe that the participants of this project and their works are
eloquent in this sense by themselves, and that the theoretical discourse
of contemporary Serbian geometric abstraction will naturally evolve from
further efforts in gathering and communication. I hope that I will have
the opportunity to witness this development in the future.</p>
