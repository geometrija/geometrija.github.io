<h3>Lorenzo Bocca (Italy)</h3>
<p>Architect, teach and painter. In 1976 he began an apprenticeship
under Alberto Sartoris, a master of twentieth-century Rationalist
architecture; in 1987 he organised and exhibition dedicated to Sartoris
in the Pietro da Cemmo room of Sant’Agostino di Crema Cultural Center in
Cremona. Bocca wrote the book “Alberto Sartoris, opere 1920/2985”,
published by Turris, Cremona. In the same year, in conjunction with
other artists and architects, he founded the CASMIPAC (Circle of Alberto
Sartoris, International Movement for a humanistic Presence in
Constructed Art). With MADI artist Angelo Giuseppe Bertolio, Bocca
worked on a series of architectural projects which were the fruit of
collaboration between artist and architect, such as the building in
Soresina used for bowling and the extension to the Genivolta Cemetery in
Cremona. Bocca subsequently carried out in-depth research on geometry in
the works of Francesco Borromini. Following this, and white the starting
point of research conducted by French priest Father Sébastien Truchet,
he explored the infinite compositional possibilities generated by the
division of a square by its diagonal. This led him to the work of
Giorgio Scarpa and o models of rotational geometry and observations on
bionics, in particular the structure of the mouth of a sea urchin, and
to a collaboration with Giuseppe Trogu (lecturer in design at San
Francisco State University) for a reinterpretation of Scarpa’s
Aristotle’s Lantern for the 2014 international “Living Machine”
conference in Milan. He has given talks at national conferences “Giorgio
Scarpa’s transformable objects: geometry as Art, Science and Play” in
Castel Bolognese (Ravenna, 2015), “The legacy of the great masters” at
the Alberto Manzi Centre in Bologna (2016) and “Encounters with
Mathematics” at Castel San Pietro Terme (Bologna, 2017). He took part in
the conference of SMIT, the International Society for Medical Innovation
and Technology, in Self (2016). He is author of the book
“Soresinateatro”, the fruit of his historical research and concrete
involvement following the decline of the nineteenth century Teatro
Sociale in Soresina. Bocca explores the expressive potential of paper,
creating sculptures achieved by folding sheets on the diagonal.He is a
member of the Astractura artistic movement, adhering to the fundamental
principle that line is the minimum and irreducible element for the
construction of a work of art. Bocca has recently exhibited his works in
the town of Nocera Inferiore as part of the collective show “Astrattismo
Ecumenico”, in the Latina Biennial of Contemporary Art, in the
collective show “Experimenta, dialoghi astrattisti” in Orta de Atella
(Caserta) and in solo shows in the cloisters of the San Domenico complex
in Crema, in Cremona’s Art Gallery and Town Hall, and in the Priamar
Fortress in Savona.He collaborated with the sculptor Paolo Mezzadri in
experiments on the expressive potential of iron and paper in the
exhibition “Dialoghi” (Cremona, 2016). He produced thirty pencil and ink
drawings for the Pulcinoelefante publishing house to illustrate the
thirteenth-century text the “Three Character Classic”. He has a work on
display at the European Community’s Joint Research Centre in Ispra
(Varese) as part of the exhibition “Art Spaces. Nuclear Decommissioning:
the science at the service of the future generation”. He has a triptych
on permanent display in the Museum of Geometric and Madi Art in Dallas
(Texas). He has published the book “Lorenzo Bocca”, sperimentare
geometrie”, edited by Francesco pagliati, with Milanese gallery Scoglio
di Quarto. He collaborates with the ICAS company for the 2018 calendar,
creating thirteen new compositions.</p>
